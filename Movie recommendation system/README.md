# Title: Movie recommendation system



## Methodology
## Description
This movie recommendation system is capable of recommending the top 20 movie preference for a user on the basis of his top 5 favourite movies and their genre.
The concept of probabilities and weighted matrices has been used to develop this model.
At first, the movie data set genre is converted into 1s and 0s (1 being genre already present). Then, the rating of the movie given by the user is multiplied and the product is used by the movie dataset system to create a weighted matrix. The score of each genre generated, which is then further used to predict movie based on the top genre score.
Project is deployed using flask and converted into a dynamic website.
